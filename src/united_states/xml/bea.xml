		<description>Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the second quarter of 2023, according to the &quot;third&quot; estimate.

Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased. Profits from current production (corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) increased $6.9 billion in the second quarter, an upward revision of $17.5 billion from the previous estimate.    &lt;!--Full Text Link--&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/gross-domestic-product-2nd-quarter-2023-third-estimate-and-corporate-profits-revised'&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--Full Text Link--&gt;</description>
